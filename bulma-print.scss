/**
 * Optional styling classes for printing pages with the Bulma CSS framework.
 * See https://github.com/suterma/bulma-print for documentation
 * 
 * Note: These classes follow the naming pattern from the visibility helpers, 
 * as documented at https://bulma.io/documentation/helpers/visibility-helpers/
 *
 * Note: Ideas are taken from
 * https://www.matuzo.at/blog/i-totally-forgot-about-print-style-sheets/
 * and from
 * https://gitlab.com/find-it-program-locator/newtowne/-/blob/8.x-1.x/src/global/_print.sass
 * As stated there, such code may get into Bulma proper with
 * https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/2329 and https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/721
